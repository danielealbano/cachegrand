Configuration
=============

## Max lockable memory and Opened files limit

cachegrand uses io_uring, a standard kernel component, to perform disk and network I/O operations; this component shares
some memory directly with the kernel which can't get swapped and has to be locked in place once allocated.

The `max_clients` parameter (explained in the next section) is dependant on the amount of lockable memory, not having
enough might prevent cachegrand from starting or, as it's used by other software e.g. browsers, desktop managers, etc.,
it might cause other kind of failures

It is also important to have a value high enough for the `open files` as in Linux the network connections are counted
towards this limit as well, to manage 10000 connections the open files limit must be greater than 10000, it is
usually safe to set it to unlimited or to a very high value.

```shell
$ ulimit -a
...
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64
...
open files                      (-n) 1024
...
```

In this case, both the `max locked memory` and the `open files` limits are too low and need to be increased.

These two limits can be safely set very high or to unlimited, cachegrand will try to set very high values at the start
but depending on the distribution or on the security settings the operation might not be allowed.

## Hugepages

cachegrand implements a novel memory allocator, called FFMA, capable of performing extremely fast allocations and frees,
able to compete with mimalloc, jemalloc and tcmalloc being faster in most of the cases.
The memory allocator is capable of leveraging the 2MB hugepages if enabled, a simple way to enable them is to set
`/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages` to the desired number of hugepages to allocate bearing in mind
that each page is 2 MB.

Here an example on how initialize 512 hugepages (1 GB of memory).
```shell
echo 512 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
```

The hugepages can also be configured to at the system boot via sysctl, the specifics depend on the distribution in use. 

Once the hugepages have been enabled in the system it's possible to set the flag `use_hugepages` to `true` in the
configuration file to enable the usage of hugepages by cachegrand.

Bear in mind that the hugepages are shared between all the processes running on the system and cachegrand has no control
over them, if hugepages are not available cachegrand will report an error and fail.

## Config file

cachegrand uses YAML for its configuration file, an example can be found in `etc/cachegrand.yaml.skel`.
