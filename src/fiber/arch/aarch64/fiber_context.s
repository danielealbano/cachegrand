    // str - Store Register (immediate) stores a word or a doubleword from a register to memory.
    // stp - Store Pair of Registers calculates an address from a base register value and an immediate offset, and stores two 32-bit words or two 64-bit doublewords to the calculated address, from two registers.
    // mov - Move between register and stack pointer
    // ldr - Load Register (immediate) loads a word or doubleword from memory and writes it to a register. The address that is used for the load is calculated from a base register and an immediate offset. For information about memory accesses, see Load/Store addressing modes.
    // ldp - Load Pair of Registers calculates an address from a base register value and an immediate offset, loads two 32-bit words or two 64-bit doublewords from memory, and writes them to two registers.
    // sub - Subtract (immediate) subtracts an optionally-shifted immediate value from a register value, and writes the result to the destination register.
    // br - Branch to Register branches unconditionally to an address in a register, with a hint that this is not a subroutine return.
