### What is cachegrand?

cachegrand is an open-source fast, scalable and modular Key-Value store designed from the ground up to take advantage of
today's hardware, compatible with the well known Redis, able to provide better performance than many other platforms.

The benchmarks below have been carried out on an **AMD EPYC 7502P** with **2 x 25Gbit** network links using
**Ubuntu 22.04**, with the default configuration and using memtier_benchmark with 10M different keys, 64 bytes of
payload, and with 100 clients per thread (1 thread 100 clients, 64 threads 6400 clients) using 2 different machines with
the same hardware to generate the load.

cachegrand is able to scale almost linearly if enough cpu power is left to the operating system to process the network
data.

</p>

Below a comparison done using batching (pipelines) with 256 commands and payloads of 64 bytes, because of the extra load
generated by the batching the amount of clients has been reduced to 10 per thread for a total of 640 clients.

Latencies are great as well, especially taking into account that with 6400 clients over 64 cores the operating system
doesn't really have too much room to handle the network traffic.

Key features:
- [Modular](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/modules.md) architecture to support
  widely used protocols, e.g.
  [Redis](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/modules/redis.md),
  [Prometheus](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/modules/prometheus.md), etc.
- [Time-series database](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/timeseries-db.md) for
  fast data writes and retrieval with primitives built to handle different data types (e.g. small strings, large blobs,
  jsons, etc.) - work in progress;
- [Hashtable](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/hashtable.md) GET Lock-free and
  Wait-free operations, SET and DELETE use localized spinlocks, the implementation is capable to digest 2.1 billion
  records per second on a 1x AMD EPYC 7502 (see
  [benches](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/hashtable.md));
- An extremely fast ad-hoc memory allocator for fixed size allocations, [Fast Fixed Memory Allocator (or FFMA)](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/fast-fixed-memory-allocator.md)
  capable of allocating and freeing memory in O(1);
- Linear vertical scalability when using the in-memory database, 2x cpus means 2x requests (see
  [benches](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/linear-vertical-scalability.md));
- [Built for flash memories](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/timeseries-db.md#flash-memories) 
  to be able to efficiently saturate the available IOPS in modern DC NVMEs and SSDs - proof of concept support;

Planned Key Features:
- More modules for additional platforms compatibility, e.g. [Memcache](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/modules/memcache.md), AWS S3,
  etc., or to add support for monitoring, e.g. [DataDog](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/modules/datadog.md),
  etc.;
- Ad ad-hoc network stack based on DPDK / Linux XDP (eXpress Data Path) and the FreeBSD network stack;
- [WebAssembly](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/webassembly.md) to provide
  AOT-compiled
  [User Defined Functions](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/webassembly/user-defined-functions.md),
  [event hooks](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/webassembly/event-hooks.md),
  implement [modules](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/webassembly.md#modules),
  you can use your preferred language to perform operations server side;
- [Replication groups](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/clustering-and-replication.md#replication-groups)
  and [replica tags](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/clustering-and-replication.md#replica-tags),
  tag data client side or use server side events to tag the data and determine how they will be replicated;
- [Active-Active](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/clustering-and-replication.md#active-active)
  [last-write-wins](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/architecture/clustering-and-replication.md#last-write-wins)
  data replication, it's a cache, write to any node of a replication group to which the replication tags are assigned,
  no need to worry it;

It's possible to find more information in the [docs'](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/)
folder.

The platform is written in C, validated via unit tests, Valgrind and integration tests, it's also built with a set of
compiler options to fortify the builds ([#85](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/issues/85)).

Currently, it runs only on Linux, on Intel or AMD cpus and requires a kernel v5.7 or newer, will be ported to other
platforms once will become more feature complete.

#### Please be aware that

cachegrand is not production ready and not feature complete, plenty of basic functionalities are being implemented,
the documentation is lacking as well as it's being re-written, please don't open issues for missing documentation.

The status of the project is tracked via GitHub using the project management board.

### Issues & contributions

Please if you find any bug, malfunction or regression feel free to open an issue or to fork the repository and submit
your PRs! If you do open an Issue for a crash, if possible please enable sentry.io in the configuration file and try to
reproduce the crash, a minidump will be automatically uploaded on sentry.io.
Also, if you have built cachegrand from the source, please attach the compiled binary to the issue as well as sentry.io
knows nothing of your own compiled binaries.

### Performances

The platform is regularly benchmarked as part of the development process to ensure that no regressions slip through,
it's possible to find more details in the [documentation](https://github.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/blob/main/docs/benchmarks.md).

### How to install

#### Distro packages

Packages are currently not available, they are planned to be created for the v0.3 milestone.

#### Build from source

Instructions on how to build cachegrand from the sources are available in the

#### Start it locally

Once cachegrand has been [built from the sources](#build-from-source), it's possible to run it with the following command

```shell
/path/to/cachegrand-server -c /path/to/cachegrand.yaml.skel
[2023-00-30T23:36:53Z][INFO       ][config] Loading the configuration from /etc/cachegrand/cachegrand.yaml
[2023-00-30T23:36:53Z][INFO       ][program] cachegrand-server version v0.1.5-5-g70d8425 (built on 2023-01-30T23:19:48Z)
[2023-00-30T23:36:53Z][INFO       ][program] > Release build, compiled using gcc v11.3.0

```

#### Docker

Simply run

```shell
docker run \
  --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 \
  --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -p 6380:6380 \
  --rm \
  cachegrand/cachegrand-server:latest
```

it comes with a default config file with redis on port 6379 and ssl for redis enabled on port 6380.

The certificate will be generated on each start, to use an ad-hoc SSL certificate, instead of the auto-generated one,
it's possible to mount the required certificate and key using the following command

```shell
docker run \
  -v /path/to/certificate.pem:/etc/cachegrand/cachegrand.pem \
  -v /path/to/certificate.key:/etc/cachegrand/cachegrand.key \
  -v /path/to/cachegrand.yaml:/etc/cachegrand/cachegrand.yaml \
  --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 \
  --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -p 6380:6380 \
  --rm \
  cachegrand/cachegrand-server:latest
```

if you want to enable prometheus or change other parameters you can download the example config file

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielealbano/cachegrand/main/etc/cachegrand.yaml.skel -o /path/to/cachegrand.yaml
```

Edit it with your preferred editor and then start cachegrand using the following command

```shell
docker run \
  -v /path/to/cachegrand.yaml:/etc/cachegrand/cachegrand.yaml \
  --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 \
  --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  -p 6380:6380 \
  --rm \
  cachegrand/cachegrand-server:latest
```
